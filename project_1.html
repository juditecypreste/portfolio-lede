				<p>Day by day, a new hit song is born. We listen to that at parties, add it to playlists and, sometimes, we can't get the tunes out of our head. However, there is something if we don't know: the world of zombie songs.</p>
				<p>Created more than five years ago, old songs are being resurrected from the dead and dominating the music charts on TikTok.</p>
				<p>An analysis of the trending songs on the platform from 120 days ago reveals some interesting numbers: out of the list of the top 100 songs, 61 are over a year old.</p>
				<p>Another 28 songs are over five years old, and within this list, 14 are over 10 years old. You can find the analysis and all the data used by clicking <a href="https://github.com/juditecypreste/zombie_songs">here</a>.</a></p>

						<p>If you listen to a song from that list, you will probably not recognize your favorite song at first. The reason is a new phenomenon, motivated by the way the users on TikTok consume their content. Now, the zombie songs return even faster.</p>
						<p>The names of the songs with the terms “speed up” or “sped up” show the modification on that melody. The voices are singing fast, as if someone is singing after inhaling helium gas. In the list, 16 were edited.</p>
						<p>Two other songs were edited too, but in a different style: now, the artists sing very slowly and move the world very calmly.</p>
